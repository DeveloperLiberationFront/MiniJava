@article{Purdy2011,
abstract = {Condoms are an important contraceptive method in Turkey, used by one in three couples using modern methods. However, withdrawal remains the most common form of contraception, resulting in many unwanted pregnancies. To address this issue and increase condom use in Turkey, DKT International, a social marketing enterprise, leveraged the high use of the Internet and social networking to help build Fiesta, a premium condom brand, and promote sales and condom use. By utilising a wide range of digital platforms--a new website, Facebook page, Google Adwords, an e-newsletter, viral marketing, banner ads and involving bloggers--Fiesta achieved strong recognition among the target audience of sexually active young people, though far more men than women. Retail audits, Internet analysis and sales performance suggest that using the Internet was instrumental in establishing Fiesta. Sales reached 4.3 million condoms (of which 8\% were sold online) in the first 18 months. In contrast, Kiss, a far more inexpensive DKT condom, launched at the same time but with no digital campaign, sold 2.6 million. With the growing availability and use of the Internet and social media globally, family planning organizations should consider incorporating these technologies into their educational, outreach and marketing programmes.},

@article{Spolsky2009,
annote = {Stack Overflow may be successful for a number of reasons:
        
Other collaborative answer sites suck because:
Paywalls between google search results and answers
Registration "speed bump"
A lot of answers are wrong (see Yahoo! Answers)
Some results are obsolete
        
What stackoverflow does right/Spolsky's 9 building blocks of a successful collaborative website:
Voting - people get to vote on what they like, people work together to make popular content more visible
Tags - people can create new tags for content, can ignore site-imposed tags, allows them to filter unwanted content and zone in on desired content
Editing - Users can edit both questions and answers
Badges - reward users, give certain users more credibility
Karma - further gamification. People will "do for free that they're not willing to do for small amounts of money" if you offer them status and privelidge
Pre-Search - autosuggest as you type
Google is UI - Google-readable URLS, sitemaps, metags, permalinks
Performance
Critical Mass
        
From the video:
Allows for editing other questions/answers
encourages mashing up best answers into better best answer and "karma whoring" that way; generates better content, gets ppl involved, reduces ownership of any one answer

First, we seek to make theorists and researchers aware of the importance of not using the terms moderator and mediator interchangeably by carefully elaborating, both conceptually and strategically, the many ways in which moderators and mediators differ. We then go beyond this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and strategic implications of making use of such distinctions with regard to a wide range of phenomena, including control and stress, attitudes, and personality traits. We also provide a specific compendium of analytic procedures appropriate for making the most effective use of the moderator and mediator distinction, both separately and in terms of a broader causal system that includes both moderators and mediators.},

@article{Parasuraman1997,
abstract = {This paper addresses theoretical, empirical, and analytical studies pertaining to human use, misuse, disuse, and abuse of automation technology. Use refers to the voluntary activation or disengagement of automation by human operators. Trust, mental workload, and risk can influence automation use, but interactions between factors and large individual differences make prediction of automation use difficult. Misuse refers to over reliance on automation, which can result in failures of monitoring or decision biases. Factors affecting the monitoring of automation include workload, automation reliability and consistency, and the saliency of automation state indicators. Disuse, or the neglect or underutilization of automation, is commonly caused by alarms that activate falsely. This often occurs because the base rate of the condition to be detected is not considered in setting the trade-off between false alarms and omissions. Automation abuse, or the automation of functions by designers and implementation by managers without due regard for the consequences for human performance, tends to define the operator's roles as by-products of the automation. Automation abuse can also promote misuse and disuse of automation by human operators. Understanding the factors associated with each of these aspects of human use of automation can lead to improved system design, effective training methods, and judicious policies and procedures involving automation use.},

@article{Hintze2008,
abstract = {Biological networks have evolved to be highly functional within uncertain environments while remaining extremely adaptable. One of the main contributors to the robustness and evolvability of biological networks is believed to be their modularity of function, with modules defined as sets of genes that are strongly interconnected but whose function is separable from those of other modules. Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and robustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing amount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous features of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free edge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance. These networks evolve in environments that differ in their predictability, and allow us to study modularity from topological, information-theoretic, and gene-epistatic points of view using new tools that do not depend on any preconceived notion of modularity. We find that for our evolved complex networks as well as for the yeast protein-protein interaction network, synthetic lethal gene pairs consist mostly of redundant genes that lie close to each other and therefore within modules, while knockdown suppressor gene pairs are farther apart and often straddle modules, suggesting that knockdown rescue is mediated by alternative pathways or modules. The combination of network modularity tools together with genetic interaction data constitutes a powerful approach to study and dissect the role of modularity in the evolution and function of biological networks.},

@article{Wismeijer2013a,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It has been generally thought that the practice of bondage-discipline, dominance-submission, sadism-masochism (BDSM) is in some form associated with psychopathology. However, several more recent studies suggest a relative good psychological health of BDSM practitioners. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare scores of BDSM practitioners and a control group on various fundamental psychological characteristics. METHODS: For this aim, 902 BDSM and 434 control participants completely filled out online questionnaires. Associations were examined using $\chi$(2) tests of independence with $\phi$ and Cramer's V as effect size measures and eta or Pearson's correlation. Group differences were tested using analysis of covariance, with partial $\eta$(2) as effect size measure. A priori contrasts were tested using $\alpha$ = 0.01 to correct for multiple testing; for all other tests we used $\alpha$ = 0.05, two tailed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study used Big Five personality dimensions (NEO Five-Factor Inventory), attachment styles (Attachment Styles Questionnaire), rejection sensitivity (Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire), and subjective well-being (World Health Organization-Five Well-being Index). RESULTS: The results mostly suggest favorable psychological characteristics of BDSM practitioners compared with the control group; BDSM practitioners were less neurotic, more extraverted, more open to new experiences, more conscientious, less rejection sensitive, had higher subjective well-being, yet were less agreeable. Comparing the four groups, if differences were observed, BDSM scores were generally more favorably for those with a dominant than a submissive role, with least favorable scores for controls. CONCLUSION: We conclude that BDSM may be thought of as a recreational leisure, rather than the expression of psychopathological processes. Wismeijer AAJ and van Assen MALM.

abstract = {Forty professional software designers participated in a study in which they worked on a software design task and reported strategies for accomplishing that task. High performers were identified by a peer-nomination method and performance on a design. Verbal protocol analysis based on a comparison of 12 high and 12 moderate performers indicated that high performers structured their design process by local planning and showed more feedback processing, whereas moderate performers were more engaged in analyzing requirements and verbalizing task-irrelevant cognitions. High performers more often described problem comprehension and cooperation with colleagues as useful strategies. High and moderate performers did not differ with respect to length of experience. None of the differences between the two performance groups could be explained by length of experience.},

Surveys sponsored by academic and government organizations have a higher response rate than commercial ones
        
Different responses to survey on sexual harassment by research institution (neutral) vs. feminist organization 
        
Topic salience one of the most important factors in survey response
        
Doesn't seem to be any literature on whether one scrolling screen or multiple pages is better
        
Mixed-mode surveys contact people via phone or mail then survey them online or do follow up with hardcopy; SMS prenotification then email invitation seems to have highest response rate
        
Personalization of email invitation does not increase response rate but increases socially desired answers to sensitive questions
        
Suggestions for invitation design: identify survey task clearly, avoid attachments and HTML documents, identify where researchers obtained  email addresses, provide time estimate contact information for help, tailor invitations to target population
        
Number of contact attempts highest predictor of response
        
First reminder after two days better than after five days in one study
        
Size of incentive does not correlate with the response rate
        
Quality of survey software i.e. reliability of survey and cross platform compatibility is important

@misc{Lawton2002,
abstract = {As the computer industry focuses on system and network security, a growing number of users are taking a closer look at open source software in order to gauge whether its potential advantages outweigh its possible disadvantages. Although open source security has been around for years, it has never been as widely used as open source products like the Linux OS or Apache Web server have been. John Pescatore, Internet security research director at market-research firm Gartner Inc., said open source security tools now represent 3 to 5 percent of security-software usage but could comprise 10 to 15 percent by 2007. A key factor in this potential growth is the quality of numerous open source security packages. Open source software products include free tools that users can download from the Internet, packages that come with commercial vendor support, and tools bundled with closed source products. The most popular tools include Netfilter and iptables; intrusion-detection systems such as Snort, Snare, and Tripwire; vulnerability scanners like Nessus and Saint; authentication servers such as Kerberos; and firewalls like T.Rex. Some companies are even beginning to use open source security to protect mission-critical applications},

@article{Bird2009,
annote = {Most binaries in Vista were not distributed.
Distributed development of a given binary did not increase the number of failures found post-release. 
Using 'Cafeteria' as a granularity of distribution was interesting.  It might be (but probably isn't) useful in Microsoft, but probably doesn't generalize to other companies.
One practice Microsoft used, and had been found helpful in previous work, was sending cross-cultural 'emissaries' to other sites.  For instance, they might send an employee who was originally from India but working in Redmond to a team in India for a few weeks to establish a good relationship between the teams.
Another helpful practice was having developers arrive early or stay late to communicate with teams in other time zones.  Team members would rotate being on this detail.  
One problem with distributed development is that it's not clear who owns what and who's accountable for what.

abstract = {Although weaknesses have been demonstrated in some security techniques (encryption, protocols, mobile code such as Java, etc.), current security technology is quite strong in many areas. Despite this, information security has proved difficult to achieve in large modern software systems. Many problems have been reported in which supposedly secure systems have been penetrated and in some cases significant damage done. In practice, it appears that many (perhaps even the majority) of serious security failures are attributable to software engineering defects in the systems experiencing the failure. The author discusses the use of wrappers which can deal with deficiencies in security and considers the software architectural approach},

@article{Payne2002,
abstract = {With the rising popularity of so-called 'open source' software there has been increasing interest in both its various benefits and disadvantages. In particular, despite its prominent use in providing many aspects of the Internet's basic infrastructure, many still question the suitability of such software for the commerce-oriented Internet of the future. This paper evaluates the suitability of open source software with respect to one of the key attributes that tomorrow's Internet will require, namely security. It seeks to present a variety of arguments that have been made, both for and against open source security and analyses in relation to empirical evidence of system security from a previous study. The results represent preliminary quantitative evidence concerning the security issues surrounding the use and development of open source software, in particular relative to traditional proprietary software.},

@article{Pickering2004,
abstract = {Traditional mechanistic accounts of language processing derive almost entirely from the study of monologue. Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.},
